Overview:

This project is an interactive, physics-based game built using object-oriented programming principles in Python. The game simulates projectile motion, collision detection, and real-time state updates, allowing users to launch fish projectiles and interact with dynamic game elements. The project demonstrates strong foundational skills in OOP design, game logic, and simulation-based programming.
